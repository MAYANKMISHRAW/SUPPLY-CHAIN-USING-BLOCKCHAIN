With blockchain, supply chain companies can document production
updates to a single shared ledger, which provides complete data
visibility and a single source of truth. Because transactions 
are always time-stamped and up to date, companies can query a
product's status and location at any point in time.
A blockchain supply chain can help participants record price,
date, location, quality, certification, and other relevant
information to more effectively manage the supply chain.
The availability of this information within blockchain 
can increase traceability of material supply chain, 
lower losses from counterfeit and gray market, improve visibility 
and compliance over outsourced contract manufacturing,
and potentially enhance an organization's position as a leader 
in responsible manufacturing.
